Welcome to my site. This is where I'll share notes, project updates, and technical writeups.

## What to expect

- Quick technical notes
- Project updates  
- ML/engineering learnings

```python
from model2vec import StaticModel

model = StaticModel.load_pretrained("resnet18")
embeddings = model.encode(["path/to/image1.jpg", "path/to/image2.jpg"])
print(embeddings)
```

## Current focus

Right now I'm working on [Model2Vec](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec) and exploring lightweight embedding models.

Replace this with your actual first post when ready.
